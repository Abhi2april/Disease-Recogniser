## Overview

Disease Recognizer uses sentence embeddings generated by the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model to encode patient symptoms into a high-dimensional space. 
Machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and KMeans Clustering, are employed to classify and group symptoms, ultimately predicting the associated disease.

## Features

- **Symptom Embedding**: Converts text-based symptoms into embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model.
- **Disease Prediction**: Classifies symptoms into disease categories using Logistic Regression.
- **Clustering**: Groups similar symptoms using KMeans Clustering.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes the embedded symptom data using t-SNE plots.
- **Interactive Prediction**: Allows for real-time disease prediction based on new symptom inputs.
